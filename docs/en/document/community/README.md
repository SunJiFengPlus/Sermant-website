Snapshot versions will not appear in Sermant's release page, they will be suffixed with **X.X.X-SNAPSHOT** in the Maven central repository. The snapshot version is used to experiment with new features before the stable version is released. Developers can use the snapshot version during the development phase to use the latest features of Sermant and help find problems with new features of Sermant.

### Stable Version

The stable version will appear in Sermant's [release page](https://github.com/huaweicloud/Sermant/releases), and it will be suffixed with **X.X.X** in the new warehouse in Maven. The stable version is released after testing, and each version will not be changed after it is released. If there is any addition or change, it will be reflected in the next stable version.
