## Current Version

The full version release record can be viewed at [github](https://github.com/sermant-io/Sermant).

## Release Cycle

- Sermant currently plans to release a feature version every three months, with the version number in the format of **X.X.0**. Each feature version will contain the latest features, and the maintenance cycle for each feature version is one year.
- Sermant currently plans to release a patch version every month or so, with a version number of **X.X.X** (the third digit of the version number is not 0). When issues affecting functionality are found in small versions, the Sermant community will promptly fix them and release patch versions.


## Version Convention

### Snapshot Version

Snapshot versions will not appear in Sermant's release page, they will be suffixed with **X.X.X-SNAPSHOT** in the Maven central repository. The snapshot version is used to experiment with new features before the stable version is released. Developers can use the snapshot version during the development phase to use the latest features of Sermant and help find problems with new features of Sermant.

### Stable Version

The stable version will appear in Sermant's [release page](https://github.com/sermant-io/Sermant/releases), and it will be suffixed with **X.X.X** in the new warehouse in Maven. The stable version is released after testing, and each version will not be changed after it is released. If there is any addition or change, it will be reflected in the next stable version.
