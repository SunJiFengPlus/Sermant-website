# monitor

This document is mainly used for the instructions of [monitor module](https://github.com/huaweicloud/Sermant/tree/develop/sermant-plugins/sermant-monitor)

## Functions

The resource monitoring module is used to monitor the use of CPU, memory, disk IO, network IO and other hardware resources of the server where the host application is located. The host application Java virtual machine has microservice use, and microservice public indicators are collected.

The monitoring module relies on prometheus to collect indicators. prometheus periodically calls the httpServer service of the java agent to obtain the indicator information registered by the plug-in and store it for display.



## Parameter configuration

```yaml
monitor.Config:                 # Monitoring service configuration
  Enable start service: false   # Monitoring service startup switch
  Address: 127.0.0.1            # Address of the host service (HTTPS is recommended)
  Port: 12345                   # Host service port information
  ReportType: PROMETHEUS        # Monitoring indicator reporting method currently only supports HTTPS
  UserName:                     # Authorization information -- Authorization user name
  Password:                     # Authorization information -- authorized user password -- AES encryption -- see AESUtil
  Key:                          # KEY used for authorized user password encryption
```

### Description of the monitor module

*Use Background*

This service includes three collection sub services, namely Linux resource monitoring and collection, JVM resource monitoring and collection, and microservice monitoring and collection

- The Linux resource monitoring and collection function requires the host application to be deployed in the Linux environment.
- The JVM memory monitoring and collection function requires the host application to use OpenJDK or the JDK version based on OpenJDK
- Microservice monitoring mainly collects the indicator information of Dubbo service and Spring Cloud service



*Function description*

- **Linux's resource monitoring and collection**: Obtain the system CPU, memory, disk IO, and network IO resource usage data by executing the Linux command, and register to the default registrar of prometheus.

```shell
    #CPU
    cat /proc/stat
    #MEMORY
    cat /proc/meminfo
    #DISK
    cat /proc/diskstats
    #NETWORK
    cat /proc/net/dev
    #CPU CORE
    lscpu
```

- **Collection content**

```shell

```

```shell
    #Other JVM indicators
    double cpu_used;        // CPU usage by JVM
    double start_time;      // JVM started time, milliseconds
```



- **Microservice monitoring collection**: intercepts the service request of the host service and calculates the public request index of the host service

```shell
    #Microservice
    double qps;                 // Requests per second
    double tps;                 // Number of request processing per second
    double avg_response_Time    // Average response time
```

## Operation and result validation
1. Modify the current monitoring configuration of plug-in config -- config yamlã€‚ Modify the IP ports and switches for external services

```yaml
monitor.Config:                 # Monitoring service configuration
  Enable start service: false   # External service switch -- When the switch is true, prometheus can call the service port to obtain indicator information
  Address: 127.0.0.1            # Modify to host service IP (HTTPS address is recommended)
  Port: 12345                   # Modified to provide external service port
```

2. Modify the configuration file of prometheus In the sketch_ Add the corresponding job information under configs (according to the content configured in step 1)

3. The host application mounts the java agent to start.

4. Start prometheus. You can view the indicator information on the prometheus page
